# Getting Started

## 1. Educate Yourself
Privacy is having the agency to decide when you reveal personal information. It is a particularly valuable quality today, when the collection and storage of personal data is taking place at unprecedented levels. We are in an age where data is of high value, and Loki aims to equip individuals with tools to obfuscate their information and interactions with the internet. Protecting your data keeps power on your side.

Loki's privacy tools offer free communication by incentivising individuals through its cryptocurrency block reward to keep the network private, secure and untraceable.

Before you start using Loki, you should [educate yourself](../Introduction/LokiNetwork.md) about how Loki will help you obfuscate your data.

## 2. Download a Privacy Tool.
Loki network enables privacy tools, and you should use them if you want to protect your privacy.

| Loki Wallets | Wallets offer a gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold, secure and trade Loki with peers.                                                                    | [Download](https://loki.network/getstarted) |

## 3. Choose Your Wallet
Loki wallets are a gateway into private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold private keys, secure Loki, stake Loki and trade peer-to-peer.

If you are unsure about which wallet to choose, check out [Which Wallet To Use](../Wallets/WhatWalletToUse.md).

## 4. Acquire Loki
Loki can be purchased on [exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/loki/#markets) with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You can also aquire Loki by [mining](../Mining/MiningOverview.md). Mining is the process of extracting Loki for securing and verifying transactions made on the blockchain.

## 5. Stake and Earn Loki
Once you own Loki, you can stake it to the network to run a Loki Service Node, with peers or by yourself, and be rewarded with additional Loki for your contribution to expanding the Loki network.

To operate a [Service Node](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md), an operator [time-locks a significant amount of Loki](../ServiceNodes/StakingRequirement.md) and provides a minimum level of bandwidth and storage to the network. In return for their services, Loki Service Node operators receive a portion of the [block reward](../Advanced/Cryptoeconomics.md) from each block.
