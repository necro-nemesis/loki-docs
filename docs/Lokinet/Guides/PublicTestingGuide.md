# Lokinet Public Testing Guide

Thanks for your interest in the public testing phase of the Lokinet alpha. It’s taken many months to get to this point, but we’re grateful to everyone who wants to give this new type of onion router a spin.

This guide will help you get Lokinet running on your machine, and give you some example tasks on things you can do to help put the software through its paces and help us find places where it needs to be fixed or can be improved. The more machines we get this running on, and the more traffic (and types of traffic) we can push through this alpha network, the better.

You can run the Loki software on any operating system. The binaries available for Linux (as .deb package), Windows 32 and 64-bit, OSX on [lokinet.org](https://lokinet.org/) website.

## Getting Help and Reporting Bugs Guidelines

The purpose of doing a public testing phase is to collect as much feedback as possible. To make this easier for both our testers and the Lokinet team, we ask that our testers stick to the following guidelines.
